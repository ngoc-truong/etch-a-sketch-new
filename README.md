# Etch-a-Sketch

In this project, an etch-a-sketch is build with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user can draw on a canvas through hovering over it. The user can also reset the canvas or change the pixel density.

The goal of this project was to recap how to manipulate the DOM via JavaScript and how to use event listeners.

This project is part of [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project),
an open source curriculum to learn full stack web development.

## Challenges
- One challenge was to create the canvas with divs using only javascript. 
- In addition, since I did not want a square canvas, I had to figure out how to create a canvas in landscape format.
