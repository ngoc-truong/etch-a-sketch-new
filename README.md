# Etch-a-Sketch

In this project, an etch-a-sketch is build via HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The 
rationale is to recap DOM manipulation in plain vanilla JavaScript. 

This project is part of [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project),
an open source curriculum to learn full stack web development.
